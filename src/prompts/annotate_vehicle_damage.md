Based on the provided image of the vehicle, generate an identical image with specific annotations overlaid transparently:

1. Outline ALL major vehicle parts (doors, hood, bumper, windshield, fenders, wheels) with a translucent CYAN color.
2. Identify any areas with visible accident damage (dents, scratches, broken parts, flat tires) and outline ONLY those damaged areas with a translucent RED color.

The original image content must remain visible underneath the annotations. Do not alter the vehicle itself, only add the glowing outlines.
If the image is NOT a vehicle, return the original image unchanged.
